# Netflix_Pandas_PostgreSQL_Project
This demo project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix movies and TV shows using Pandas and PostgreSQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer key business questions based on the dataset. Pandas is used to prepare and clean the dataset, and then the cleaned data is loaded into PostgreSQL for further analysis.
